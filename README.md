<h1>Kinematics Simulator Parallel Robot</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I developed the direct and inverse kinematics of a parallel robot.This project was developed for a project that the University of Calabria is doing. The purpose is to make a digital twin of a parallel robot that they have developed in order to give rehabilitation through videogames. I developed the research of the equations for the direct and inverse kinematics of the robot. Them apply all the math and put them in C# code to be used in Unity 3D. Then, using Arduino it was possible to control the inverse and direct kinematics using potentiometers.
